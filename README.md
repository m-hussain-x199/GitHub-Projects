# 📘 C Programming Practice Projects

This repository contains a collection of small C programs that demonstrate various fundamental concepts of the C programming language. These files are created for learning, practice, and revision of core programming skills.

# 📂 Files Included

- main.c	Entry point file. Often used to call other functions or demonstrate logic.
- fibonacci.c	Generates Fibonacci series using loops or recursion.
- functions.c	Contains examples of user-defined functions and function calls.
- menu.c	Implements a basic menu-driven program for user interaction.
- patterns.c	Prints various patterns using loops (stars, numbers, pyramids, etc.).
- practise.c	General practice code – mix of small C problems and logic implementations.
- program.c	Likely contains a standalone program implementing a particular concept.
- recusions.c	Demonstrates recursive functions (e.g., factorial, Fibonacci, etc.).

# 💡 Topics Covered

- Variables and data types

- Conditional statements and loops

- Functions and recursion

- Pattern printing

- Menu-based logic

- Modular programming
